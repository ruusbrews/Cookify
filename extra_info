"""
how does it work?
- asks user to upload picture of fridge/shelf or to list ingredients they have on hand
- asks user to enter any preferences (can include dietary restrictions, time restrictions, etc.) - this step is optional
- by clicking a "generate" button, a loading message will appear as all user-input information is added to chatbot prompt and recipe collected
- outputs a step by step recipe according to user-input info
- there is a regenerate button in case the recipe is disliked, will generate a new recipe while still keeping the old one

further details:
- linked to Microsoft Azure OpenAI's gpt-4o model
- have to create an ENV file with API key, endpoint and regional link for gpt model
- i would decrease hallucination to avoid unrealistic recipes
